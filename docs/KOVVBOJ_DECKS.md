# KOVVBOJ — two decks, crossfaded through transition shaders

Prepare the next look invisibly on one deck while the other is live, then take
it over with one gesture.

Written 2026-09-10 against `main` @ 5ec392f. Branch `kovvboj-decks`.

## The model

**A deck is a `ChannelGroup`.** Not a new container type — the one already in
`rustjay-mixer`, which composites its members into its own accumulators, runs
its own FX chain, and parks the finished image in `group_out`
(`rustjay-mixer/src/lib.rs:328`, render at `:1040-1120`).

- Two **permanent** top-level groups, A and B. Created on first run, not
  deletable, never nested (`parent` is always `None`).
- Groups nest **inside** decks: `ChannelGroup.parent: Option<String>`, rendered
  deepest-first so a child's `group_out` is ready when its parent composites.
  Depth is general; a cycle guard rejects a group that is its own ancestor.
- A layer in **neither** deck blends into master as it does today — an
  always-live overlay tier that ignores the fader. Free, and useful.
- There is no "one big stack" mode any more. Single-deck working is
  "everything in A, never touch the fader".

### Why not two `Mixer`s

The first draft of this plan had `decks: [Mixer; 2]`, master FX relocated onto
`KovvbojAppState`, a `deck: u8` on `LayerDesc`, and an extract-method on
`Mixer::render_to`. All four are unnecessary: `ChannelGroup` already does every
one of those jobs. Deck membership is already `Channel.group` /
`GroupDesc.members`; master FX already runs after groups; `master_dim` already
applies to group opacity (`lib.rs:1156`); `group_out` is already the texture a
transition needs.

This also avoids re-introducing a parallel container beside `Channel` — which
is exactly the `Deck`/`Channel` incoherence deleted on 2026-09-02 (`d30dc97`,
`KOVVBOJ_UI.md` "Revision — the layer model").

## The transition

Before the master pass, deck A's and deck B's `group_out` textures go through
one ISF transition shader; the result is blended **once** into the master
accumulator, in place of blending the two decks separately. Master chain,
`master_dim` and the final blit are untouched.

**Crossfader position *is* `progress`.** One control, one uniform. A plain
dissolve is `transition_dissolve.fs` at `progress = fader`, so there is no
separate crossfade code path. Transitions are therefore symmetric and
reversible — pull the fader back and the wipe un-wipes. Correct for all nine
shipped shaders.

**Early-out:** at exactly `0.0` / `1.0`, skip the transition pass and blend the
winning deck directly. Saves a full-screen pass whenever the fader is parked,
which is most of the time. This assumes `transition(A,B,0.0) == A`, true for
the shipped set and not guaranteed for an arbitrary ISF; a one-frame pop on an
exotic shader is accepted rather than paying a pass every frame forever.

## The one engine change

`crates/kovvboj/shaders/transition_*.fs` — nine shaders (dissolve, four wipes,
push, iris, zoom, luma_key) with `startImage` / `endImage` / `progress` — have
been dead assets since the varda port. They cannot run: an ISF effect bound
every image input to the one primary texture (`rustjay-isf/src/effect.rs`), so
`startImage` and `endImage` were the same image — a transition mixed a frame
with itself and `progress` did nothing visible.

The second texture **already reaches the plugin boundary**:
`plugin_renderer.rs:604` does `let feedback = inputs.get(1)` and carries it into
`FrameInputs.feedback_view` / `feedback_sampler`. It is then dropped when
`RenderHookCtx` is built at `:658`, which sets only `input`.

So: forward those two existing fields into `RenderHookCtx`, and have
`rustjay-isf` bind them to the **second declared image input** — by
**declaration order**, not by name. Order is what ISF hosts effectively do, and
name conventions differ across corpora (`startImage`/`endImage`,
`inputImage`/`inputImage2`, `from`/`to`).

This is additive and generally useful: any two-input ISF works afterwards.

**Done** — `ca7bcb4`. `RenderHookCtx.input_b`, `IsfEffect::secondary_texture`,
and `m_second_image_input_binds_to_input_b` in `render_pixels.rs` asserting
progress 0 / 1 / 0.5. Verified non-vacuous: with the bind arm disabled,
progress 1 renders the *first* input.

**The nine shipped shaders need no port.** They are varda-era GLSL 450 with
hand-written `layout(set=0, binding=N)` declarations rather than ISF idiom,
which looked like a problem; it is not. All nine transpile and render correctly
through `rustjay-isf` with the second input bound. Checked directly, red as A
and blue as B:

| | progress 0 | progress 1 |
|---|---|---|
| dissolve, wipe ×4, push, zoom, luma_key | exactly A | exactly B |
| iris | (253,0,2) — 2/255 off | exactly B |

`ISF_CORPUS_DIR=crates/kovvboj/shaders cargo test -p rustjay-isf --test
batch_compile corpus` also compiles 129/130 of the whole kovvboj shader
directory (the one failure, `gs_25363.1.fs`, is not a transition).

**This settles the early-out.** `transition(A,B,0.0) == A` holds exactly for
eight of nine, and `iris` deviates by 2/255 from edge softness at the iris
boundary — imperceptible. Skipping the pass at 0.0/1.0 is safe for the shipped
set.

## Budget

- **16 layers** (`MAX_CHANNELS`, unchanged).
- **8 groups total**, including the two decks.

Group count, not layer count, is the memory constraint.
`ChannelGroup::ensure_resources` allocates **four full-resolution textures per
group** — `acc_a`, `acc_b`, `chain_ping`, `group_out` — about **133 MB per
group at 4K RGBA8**. Eight groups is ~1 GB if all are populated, against a
current total working set of 300–515 MB.

**Allocate lazily**: a group with no members, or a muted one, allocates
nothing. An empty deck costs zero. `ensure_resources` is already called inside
the `members.is_empty() { continue; }` guard's scope, so this is a small change.

Both decks render **every frame** (they are groups; groups already do). Deck B
is live-but-unrouted. Waking a deck on demand was rejected: videos would jump
and `PHASE_TIME` generators would snap exactly as you cut to them.

## Isolation

The premise of the feature is that work on the prep deck cannot disturb the
live deck. Enforced in three places.

### Undo becomes a diff-based apply

`crates/kovvboj/src/lib.rs:688` currently reads:

> *ponytail: replaying a whole topology rebuilds every source, so an undo costs
> a hitch and restarts video playback. Acceptable for structural edits; the
> upgrade path is a diff-based apply that only touches the nodes that actually
> changed.*

Acceptable with one deck. With two it is not — an undo in the prep deck would
rebuild the live deck's decoders and hitch the screen mid-show. Build the
documented upgrade path.

**It replaces full replay entirely — it does not sit beside it.** Loading a
scene whose uuids are all new degenerates to "add everything", which is exactly
correct, so the old replay function is deleted. One path, constantly exercised,
cannot rot.

Matching is by uuid at both levels:

| Case | Action |
|---|---|
| layer uuid in both | set knobs / name / group in place; keep the instance |
| `SourceEntry` differs | route through the existing `PendingSourceSwap` path (`lib.rs:227`) — re-point live, do not rebuild the channel |
| layer only in desired | build |
| layer only in live | remove |
| fx slot uuid in both, path same | keep |
| fx slot path changed | rebuild that slot only |
| `enabled` changed | set the flag |
| order changed | reorder (uuid-stable prefixes, `move_effect`) |

Two traps:

1. **Bump `generation` whenever the channel set or order changes.**
   `add_channel` / `remove_channel` do; a diff that mutates `channels` directly
   must too, or the composite bind-group cache keyed by slot index
   (`rustjay-mixer/src/lib.rs:429`) serves stale bindings and layers render each
   other's textures. Presents as a GPU driver bug.
2. **`SourceEntry` equality is the rebuild trigger** — compare `kind`, `path`,
   `device_index` **and `text`**. `id` and `name` differing must **not** force a
   decoder rebuild, so do not blanket-derive `PartialEq` and forget. (`text` was
   missed when this plan was written: it is what a text layer rasterises, not a
   label, so editing it *must* rebuild.)

**Done** — `f6a91ca`. `plan_layers` / `plan_chain` are pure decision functions
with 11 headless tests; `apply_topology` executes them. Deciding whether to
build a channel needs no GPU, so the load-bearing logic is testable without one.

Fixed a pre-existing leak on the way past: the old code cleared `channels` and
`master` but **never `groups`**, while the group loop pushed a fresh
`ChannelGroup` every time — so every undo, redo and scene load duplicated every
group, at four full-resolution textures each. Rebuilding the groups vec from the
desired set makes that structurally impossible.

### Solo scopes to its deck subtree

`rustjay-mixer/src/lib.rs:550` — `any_solo` is
`channels.any(solo) || groups.any(solo)`, global, and the group pass gates on it
at `:1053`. Today, soloing one layer in deck A blanks every non-soloed group,
**including deck B**.

`any_solo` becomes a per-subtree computation in `effective_opacities`. An
ungrouped layer forms its own scope.

### Move, not copy

Dragging a layer between stacks is a **move**: same uuid, same source instance,
same ISF params, same modulation routings — one field changes.

**No copy verb ships.** A copy is a deep copy: fresh uuids, fresh param
prefixes, a `rekey_prefix` dance, modulation assignments *not* inherited, and a
duplicated source means a **second decoder**. Only cameras are shared (the
global `CAMERA_SESSIONS` map, `sources/camera_source.rs:54`); `ffmpeg_source`,
`hap_source`, NDI and Syphon are per-instance, and 4K software decode is the
single largest CPU cost in the app. Wanting the same clip in both decks means
adding it twice from the library, and it should feel like two decoders, because
it is. Copy stays additive, to add later with that cost understood.

## Control surface

`"crossfader"` is a **registered custom param**, min 0 / max 1. It then
inherits MIDI MAP, LFO MAP, OSC, audio-band routing and the step sequencer with
no new code. The mixer already reads it — `lib.rs:719` is
`engine.get_param("crossfader").unwrap_or(self.crossfader)` — and the key has
precedent in `preset.rs`'s legacy modulation tests.

The transition shader's own ISF inputs register under a `transition_` prefix,
mappable exactly like any FX param.

**`AutoCrossfade` / `BeatSyncCrossfade` / the sequencer write the *base*
value**; modulation adds on top in `get_param` (`rustjay-core/src/state.rs:1406`
— base, plus offset, clamped to the descriptor range). If auto-fade wrote the
final value, an LFO on the crossfader would be double-applied during a TAKE.
One owner per layer of the stack. See the `get_param` double-contribution note
in the modulation-unification work.

**TAKE is an action, not a param** — a button plus a key in `keymap.rs`, setting
`mixer.auto = Some(AutoCrossfade { … })`. Params are continuous; forcing an
event into them means inventing a trigger-on-threshold convention.
`AutoCrossfade`, `BeatSyncCrossfade`, `Easing` and `SequencerState` are all
already built and tested in `rustjay-mixer`, and have been unused since the
crossfader was deleted. This wires them up; it writes none of them.

MIDI-note binding for TAKE is later and additive.

## Persistence

`Scene` gains:

- the two deck group uuids
- `crossfader: f32`
- `transition: Option<PathBuf>`, relativized like `FxDesc.path`

Transition params ride the existing `params: HashMap<String, f32>` under the
fixed `transition_` prefix, exactly as `master_fx<uuid>_` does. No new
mechanism.

**`mixer_state` stays.** (An earlier draft deleted it as redundant with
`Topology`; that was only forced by the two-`Mixer` design. With one mixer,
`MixerState.crossfader` is the natural home for the fader value.)

`GroupDesc` gains `parent: Option<String>`.

No `TOPOLOGY_VERSION` bump and no migration: every addition is `serde(default)`
and defaults correctly. An old scene loads as a flat stack with two empty decks.
Unlike the 2026-09-02 break, nothing here is lossy — do not manufacture a
migration that is not needed.

### Savable / recallable decks

`SavedLayer` / `SavedChain` / `SavedGroup` already exist with capture,
uuid-rekeying recall and tests (`scene/mod.rs:224-470`, `:840`). Since decks are
groups, most of this is built. Two gaps:

1. **`SavedGroup` has no nested groups.** `capture` takes a flat
   `layers: Vec<LayerDesc>` (`:397`). Add `groups: Vec<GroupDesc>`, remapping
   `parent` pointers and `members` lists onto the fresh uuids. Extend
   `recalling_a_group_rekeys_everything_under_it` as the test pattern.
2. **`instantiate()` mints a fresh `group_uuid`** (`:453`) — right for dropping
   a copy into the stack, wrong for loading into a deck. Add
   **`instantiate_into(deck_uuid)`**: everything underneath gets fresh uuids as
   today, but the top-level group **keeps the target deck's uuid**, with the
   saved opacity / blend / FX applied onto it.

A deck is fixed furniture with controls bound to it. `grp_<deckA>_opacity` must
stay where the MIDI fader is mapped across every recall — otherwise the
save/recall feature is hostile to the performance surface.

With the diff-based apply, recalling into deck B rebuilds only deck B's nodes;
deck A keeps playing untouched.

## UI

Central panel splits into **two collapsible vertical stacks**, A left, B right.
Below them a strip:

```
[ preview A ]   [ ◀── crossfader ──▶  ▼ dissolve   TAKE ]   [ preview B ]
```

Master panel stays below, unchanged (`shell.rs:408`).

- Library **SOURCES** rows get `[A][B]` buttons instead of one `➕` — no
  focused-deck ambiguity.
- Library **EFFECTS** rows keep a single `➕`, appending to the *selected*
  layer's chain. `Selection` is keyed by layer uuid (`lib.rs:59-70`), so it
  already knows which deck. The asymmetry is honest: sources make layers,
  effects join a layer.
- Deck previews come from each deck's `group_out` (needs an accessor), through
  two `create_preview_texture` slots (`rustjay-gui/src/egui_renderer.rs:138`)
  copied with `copy_texture_to_texture` at preview size. kovvboj publishes the
  two deck output textures on `EngineState`; the **host** does the copy, in the
  same place it already copies master output, keeping it on the render thread.
  Ids reach the UI as `[Option<u64>; 2]`, following the existing
  `stage_preview_texture_id` pattern (`rustjay-core/src/state.rs:992`).

**Known hazard:** `KOVVBOJ_UI.md`'s unresolved nested-panel bug — centre
overpaints the inspector by ~34 px from nested deprecated `Panel::show`. The
crossfader strip is another nested panel inside `CentralPanel`, landing right on
top of it. Budget for it.

## Verification

Cheap, headless, high value:

1. **Diff-apply unit tests** — the load-bearing new logic, and pure.
   `rustjay-mixer` has a `Stub` `EffectInstance` for headless tests. Assert: a
   no-op diff rebuilds nothing; reorder preserves instances; a knob change
   preserves instances; a `SourceEntry` change swaps the source without
   rebuilding the channel.
2. **Scene round-trip** — an old scene with no `parent` / no deck uuids loads as
   a flat stack with two empty decks.
3. **One GPU pixel test for the second input** — two solid-colour inputs through
   `transition_dissolve.fs` at `progress = 0.5`, assert the midpoint colour.
   Reuses the existing harness in `rustjay-isf/tests/render_pixels.rs`, which
   already builds a `RenderHookCtx` and reads pixels back. This is the only
   thing that proves the second texture binds rather than sampling black.

**Skipped:** kittest UI snapshots. Two already fail unconditionally on macOS and
CI never sees them; deck snapshots would add noise, not signal.

**Hands-on, not automatable:** build both decks, scrub the fader through all
nine transitions, confirm nothing pops and both previews stay live.

## Build order

The first two are independently useful and mergeable before any deck work
exists.

1. ~~**`input_b`** — forward the second input through `RenderHookCtx`, bind by
   declaration order in `rustjay-isf`, GPU pixel test.~~ **Done** `ca7bcb4`.
2. ~~**Diff-based apply** replacing full topology replay, with unit tests.~~
   **Done** `f6a91ca`.
3. ~~**Nested groups** — `parent` on `ChannelGroup` / `GroupDesc`, depth-first
   render, cycle guard, 8-group cap, lazy allocation, per-subtree solo.~~
   **Done** `60681ef`. Solo scopes to *siblings* at each level, which is
   stricter than "per deck subtree" and is the correct model. Fixed a second
   pre-existing bug: the master pass anchored a group at its topmost member
   outright, but only visits contributing channels — so muting the top layer of
   a group stopped the whole group being blended.
4. ~~**Deck roles** — two permanent top-level groups, transition pass between
   their `group_out`, `"crossfader"` registered as a param, 0/1 early-out.~~
   **Done** `2cff0d3` (mixer) + `255b74e` (kovvboj).

   Two things the plan got wrong: `"crossfader"` was **already** registered by
   `Mixer::parameters()`, so that item was zero work. And `prepare` holds
   `&EngineState`, so the fader reaches `transition_progress` through
   `EngineState::param_restore` — the queue the renderer drains each frame,
   which exists for exactly this.

   Not yet exercised in the app — no UI reaches the fader or picks a shader
   until step 5, so this is compiled and unit-tested but not seen.
5. **UI** — two stacks, crossfader strip, `[A][B]` library buttons, transition
   picker: **done** `40d257d` + `86257a6`. Run and confirmed working: an iris
   wipe rendering deck B over deck A mid-fader, the picker swapping shaders
   live, the early-out showing deck A alone at rest.

   **The crossfader dying after a deck edit was not a deck bug at all.**
   `Mixer::decks`, both deck groups, their `rendered` flags and the deck
   anchor were all intact through every edit — instrumented and read off a
   live run. What broke was one layer down:
   `CompositePipeline` caches bind groups on `(slot, dest_is_a)` for a
   `generation`, on the assumption that a slot's source texture is fixed
   while that key is. The deck slot is fed deck A's `group_out`, deck B's,
   or the transition output purely according to the fader, and none of
   those moves bumps `generation` — so the master kept sampling whichever
   texture the entry was first built from. Parked at A it froze on deck A's
   output, which is live, so the picture kept moving and only the fader
   looked dead; the next unrelated edit invalidated the cache and the
   picture jumped, which is what made an edit look like the cause. Fixed by
   storing the source texture's allocation id with the cache entry
   (`ae651c1`), with a GPU regression test. The same staleness covered a
   group reallocating `group_out` after a mute, and a source swapped in
   place.

   **The library `[B]` button was unclickable** because the rows laid out
   right-to-left against the panel edge that carries the scroll bar and the
   resize grip — two buttons did not fit where one `➕` had, and the second
   was clipped past the visible width at any panel size. The buttons moved
   to the left gutter beside the star (`ce8072f`).

   ~~**Still open:** the flanking previews are placeholders.~~ **Done.** A deck
   is a group, so its preview is that group's thumbnail: `Thumbnails` already
   owned a small render target per layer, blitted into it on the render hook and
   registered the view with the host, so groups joined that loop and the shell
   publishes the two ids into `deck_preview_texture_ids`. Not the host-side
   `create_preview_texture` path: that copy crops rather than scales, so it
   would mean two full-resolution copies a frame to look right —
   `register_texture_view` exists for exactly this and says so.
   `ChannelGroup::output()` is the accessor.

   **The last unexplained report is closed.** "At the crossfader extremes the
   deck faded to stops rendering new frames in the preview" does not reproduce
   now that there is something to observe: parked hard at either end, three
   screenshots a second apart differ in both previews. Both decks render every
   frame, as designed.

   The [`KOVVBOJ_UI.md`] nested-panel bug did **not** bite: the crossfader strip
   is another nested `Panel::bottom` inside the same child `Ui` and it lays out
   correctly. What did bite was a deck drawing its own group header inside its
   own column — unreadable at half width.
6. ~~**TAKE** — wire `AutoCrossfade` / `BeatSyncCrossfade` / sequencer to the
   crossfader base value.~~ **Done.** `prepare` decides who owns the fader each
   frame: idle, the operator does and `mixer.crossfader` is synced *from* the
   base, so the next TAKE starts where the fader sits; running, it publishes
   what the tick produced *as* the base, never the modulated value.

   Ownership outlives the transition by one frame — `tick_transitions` clears
   `auto` on the same call that yields the final value, so "is one running"
   alone drops the settle frame and the fader springs back.

   TAKE is a button in the strip and ⌘T in the shell; its length is a
   parameter (`take_seconds`), so it is mappable and rides in the scene's
   existing `params`. A TAKE stops a running sequence, because the sequencer
   outranks `auto` in the tick and a button that did nothing would read as
   broken.
7. ~~**Savable decks** — `SavedGroup` nesting, `instantiate_into(deck_uuid)`.~~
   **Done.** `SavedGroup.groups` holds every nested group; `layers` now means
   every layer at any depth, and membership is what the `members` lists say.
   `instantiate` returns a `RecalledGroup` and remaps in two passes — fresh
   names, then the `parent` / `members` pointers once every new name exists.
   `instantiate_into(deck_uuid)` pins the top of the tree so
   `grp_deck_a_opacity` survives a recall. Recalling into a deck replaces what
   is on it (with the modulation sweep a removal does); into the free stack it
   still adds. 💾 on the deck column heading saves; the library's GROUPS rows
   grew the same `[A][B]` buttons the source rows have.

## What user testing found

Three, all of them the same shape underneath: a deck is a group, and the code
that made groups did not know decks existed.

1. **Grouping layers inside a deck made them vanish.** `group_channels` pushed
   the new group at top level, which took its members *out* of the deck. In deck
   mode neither column lists a layer that is on no deck, and the transition does
   not composite one, so they were unreachable and read as deleted. A new group
   now inherits whatever its members already shared — grouping inside a folder
   keeps you in the folder — which is a general rule that happens to fix decks.
   `ungroup` had the same bug in reverse (members and nested groups dropped to
   `None`, orphaning them and leaving dangling parent pointers), and so did
   "remove from group".

   **Edge cases:** a pick spanning both decks, or mixing decked and free layers,
   is **refused** with a notification. Silently moving layers between decks
   during a gesture that says nothing about decks is worse than saying no. The
   gather-to-contiguous can reorder members past a layer of the other deck; that
   is harmless, because deck membership is `Channel::group`, not an index range,
   and both decks resolve to one image at one anchor.

   **The guard:** `Mixer::channels_off_deck` names the condition, `prepare`
   warns when it changes, and — since the free tier is a deliberate part of the
   design, not something to repair away — deck A's column now lists those layers
   under **NOT ON A DECK — ignores the crossfader**. A layer nothing lists is
   indistinguishable from a deleted one; that is the whole bug, so the fix is to
   list it.

2. **Deck saves could not be named** and overwrote each other: a deck's name is
   always "Deck A", and that is what the filename came from. The heading now
   carries a name field, Enter or 💾 to save, and an amber "replaces" the moment
   the typed name matches something already saved — the shape `MixerTab` already
   uses for the master chain.

3. **Saved decks were filed under GROUPS.** The library lists **DECKS** and
   **GROUPS** separately, split on `SavedGroup::is_deck()` — *derived* from
   `group_uuid` rather than stored as a flag and rather than moved to their own
   directory. One directory stays one namespace, there is nothing to migrate,
   and every file already in a workspace classifies itself correctly.

**Still open, and pre-existing:** a layer row has a minimum width — the blend
picker and the mix buttons do not shrink — that a half-window deck column can be
under. The first row over the width used to widen every row after it, which is
how deck A's layers came to be painted across deck B; the columns now scroll in
both axes, so an over-wide row is contained and reachable instead. Making the
row itself fit a narrow column is a separate piece of work: something has to
give way, and deciding what is a design question, not a bug fix.

## Note on provenance

The first half of the design session was conducted against the
`kovvboj-layers` worktree, which is **merged and 121 commits stale**. The
`ChannelGroup` machinery that collapses most of this plan landed after it.
Read `main`.
