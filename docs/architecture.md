# KOVVBOJ architecture

KOVVBOJ is the flagship application built on [rustjay-engine](https://github.com/BlueJayLouche/rustjay-engine) — a complete
performance tool rather than a single-effect demo. It assembles
`rustjay-mixer`, `rustjay-isf`, `rustjay-api`, and the modulation stack into one
runnable app.

```sh
cargo run                       # default: mixer + egui + webcam + LED
cargo run --features projection # add the Stage / projection-mapping output
cargo run --all-features        # NDI, Syphon, ProDJ, HAP, ffmpeg, recording…
```

## What it is

A **layer** is one visual: a source, its FX chain, an opacity and a blend mode
against the layers beneath it. The top of the stack composites over the
bottom, and that is the whole structure — there is no channel level above the
layers and no crossfader. In its place a pinned MASTER row carries a
**dimmer** (a real engine parameter, so MIDI, OSC and LFOs reach it) and the
master FX chain that every layer passes through on its way out.

You bring `.fs` ISF shaders and video sources; kovvboj handles the routing,
compositing, modulation, and output. The control window is a three-column egui
shell: the library on the left, the layer stack in the centre, a live preview
and the inspector on the right. The centre column switches between MIX, STAGE
and MAP modes; everything else opens as windows from the View menu.

## Key concepts

- **Layers** — each layer is a `rustjay_mixer::Channel`: the source lives in
  its `effect` slot, ISF filters in its `chain`, with opacity, one of 15 blend
  modes, solo and mute on top. Sources (`CameraSource`, `SolidColorSource`,
  ISF generators, NDI/Syphon/Spout receivers, optional
  `FfmpegSource`/`HapSource`/`StreamSource`) feed the chain. Restack the pile
  by dragging a layer's `≡` handle.
- **The library** — four groups with different verbs. DEVICES (cameras, NDI,
  Syphon, Spout), MEDIA (images, videos, streams) and GENERATORS (solid
  colour, generator shaders) each make a new layer from their ➕. EFFECTS
  (filter shaders — an ISF that declares an `inputImage`) append to the
  selected layer from theirs, and are the only rows that drag: drop one onto
  any layer's chain or the master chain. DEVICES always lists a generic
  `NDI…` / `Syphon…` / `Spout…` entry so you can build the layer before the
  sender exists — pick the actual server in the inspector, which can also
  re-point a live layer without losing its chain or mappings.
- **NDI over a slow link** — full-bandwidth NDI at 1080p runs ~100-125 Mbps, and
  a link that cannot carry it does not degrade gently: you get a couple of
  frames a second rather than a softer picture. Set
  `RUSTJAY_NDI_LOW_BANDWIDTH=1` to receive NDI's proxy stream instead (roughly
  640x360, a few Mbps), which is what WiFi can actually carry. It is read once
  at startup and applies to every receiver; the log says which stream a source
  connected on.
- **Text layers** — a Text layer draws a string one quad per glyph, out of a
  font atlas. The atlas is either a TTF/OTF rasterised on load, or an image you
  drew. A drawn atlas gets its characters from a text file beside it with the
  same name — one line per row of the grid, so the file's shape *is* the
  mapping:

  ```text
  ABCDEFGH
  IJKLMNOP
  ```

  Without that sidecar the grid is assumed to be printable ASCII in 16
  columns; the inspector says which it used and how many characters it mapped,
  which is the thing to check when the wrong letters come out. Because every
  glyph is its own quad, Wave, Spin, Explode and Stagger animate letters
  individually, and Spin carries a perspective divide so a letter turns rather
  than squashes. Turn and Tilt do the same to the whole string — Turn Rate
  spins it continuously, in whole revolutions per cycle, so a synced string
  comes back round on the bar. Speed/Sync/Division drive all of that animation
  on the same tempo lock clips and shaders use. The copy is settable over OSC at
  `/rustjay/text/<layer>`, matched on the layer's name or uuid.
- **FX chains** — two places FX live: per layer, and master. Reorder within a
  chain or move an effect between chains by dragging its chip; click a chip's
  dot to bypass it.
- **Undo/redo** — ⌘Z / ⇧⌘Z cover structural edits: adding, removing, moving
  and re-ordering layers and effects. Parameter changes are deliberately not
  undoable — they are continuous and driven by MIDI/LFO/OSC.
- **Workspaces** — a workspace is a directory (`.kovvboj/` beside the app by
  default): scene, stage, keymap and your saved layers/chains/groups. The File
  menu makes and switches them — New, Open, Open Recent, Save (⌘S), Save As,
  Revert to Saved — saving the live set before it switches. New into a folder
  that already holds a scene opens it rather than overwriting it.
- **Set bundles** — File → Export Set writes a `.kovvbojset`: the workspace plus
  a copy of every shader, clip and image the scene points at, with the recorded
  paths rewritten to match. Import unpacks it beside the archive and opens it,
  so a set moves between machines whole. It is an uncompressed tar — video does
  not compress — so `tar -xf` opens one anywhere.
- **Scene persistence** — layers and FX survive save/reload. Scenes are
  versioned: one written before the layer model is not loaded — kovvboj tells
  you the scene predates layers and leaves the file untouched. Scenes store
  *topology descriptors* and replay them with preserved UUIDs, so reloaded
  stacks reconnect to their MIDI/LFO mappings. See `scene::Scene` and
  `persistence/`.
- **Stage mode** (`--features projection`) — place output surfaces on a canvas,
  with an aspect-correct, zoomable **live preview** of the master output and
  per-surface pixel sizing. Surfaces feed `rustjay-projection`; a projector
  can draw several, each with its own source, crop and warp, ticked in its
  Outputs row. Edge blend applies to the projector's composited frame.
- **LED Map mode** — calibrate addressable LED strips and play them back over
  sACN. See [Lighting & LED](https://bluejaylouche.github.io/rustjay-engine/lighting.html).
- **Outputs** — window output plus lifecycle-managed NDI / Syphon senders
  (broadcast as `kovvboj — <name>`) from the Outputs window. The top bar shows
  WEB / OSC / sink pills for whatever is live, alongside BPM and FPS readouts.
- **External control** — the Web parameter server, OSC, and MIDI all reach
  into any mapped parameter, including the master dimmer. Arm MIDI-learn or
  LFO-assign from the MIDI / Modulation windows, then click a control in the
  inspector to bind it.
